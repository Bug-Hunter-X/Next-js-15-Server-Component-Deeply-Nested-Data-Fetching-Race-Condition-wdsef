# Next.js 15 Server Component Data Fetching Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a subtle race condition that can occur in Next.js 15 when fetching data for deeply nested server components. The issue manifests as a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined` error, which is often difficult to debug due to the asynchronous nature of the problem.

## Problem Description

When a server component fetches data that's then passed down to deeply nested components, there's a possibility that the parent component renders before the nested component's data has been fetched. This leads to the nested component trying to access properties of an undefined object.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring all asynchronous operations related to data fetching complete before the components render.  This can be achieved using techniques like conditional rendering or dedicated loading states.
